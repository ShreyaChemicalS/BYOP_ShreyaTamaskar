I have worked on Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimisation(MFBO) with three fidelities. Entire code has been posted in this repository.
There are 2 code files and 2 dataset files. One code file contains MFBO with single LF which I had worked on prior to starting with MFBO with 3LFs. 
The dataset named 'esterification_dataset.csv' is for the file MFBO_singleLF and the 'properly_calibrated_3LF_dataset.csv' is for the MFBO with 3LFs saved in 'mfboAnother'.
